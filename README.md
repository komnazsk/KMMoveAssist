# KMMoveAssist

KMMoveAssist is a Minecraft Spigot plugin that enhances player movement by allowing configurable distance-based teleportation using an item.

## Features

- **Right-Click to Move:**
  - Hold an item (default is a clock) and right-click to move in the direction you're facing.
  - The default movement distance is 20 blocks.
  - If the destination is blocked, you'll be teleported to a safe location above the block.
  - Movement won't occur below the worldâ€™s minimum height.

- **Left-Click to Change Distance:**
  - Hold an item (default is a clock) and left-click to cycle through different movement distances.
  - Available distances are 20, 40, 80, and 160 blocks.

- **Configurable Item:**
  - The item used for movement can be changed in the `config.yml` file by setting the `move-item` value.

## Permissions

You can configure the following permissions. By default, both permissions are set to OP only.
